## Binary Classification Problem: Is this mushroom poisonous or not? 

Using the [mushroom dataset], we will study how a machine learning model can predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or not given its features.
While this dataset  was originally curated more than 30 years ago by the UCI Machine Learning repository, mushroom hunting is still relevant to this day and the data provides for a good case-study of modeling with categorical variables only.

In this notebook, we will survey the various steps of a data science project:
- Data Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Selection
- Data Modeling
- Hyperparameter Tuning 

By doing so we will find out which features are most indicative of a poisonous mushroom and see which machine learning models perform best for this task.
